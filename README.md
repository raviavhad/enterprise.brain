**Problem Statement addressed (or explain your own): [ ]**

Every enterprise sits on a mountain of data. We strongly feel that each of these enterprises could be more agile, cognizant and live through Digital brain. 

This could be well address harnessing the power of scalable graph technology like TigerGraph together with advanced analytics, AI and machine learning.

**Description**: 

Built as a solution, Enterprise.Brain comprises of the following core components:
•	Core Cognitive Services to build and apply intelligence
•	Agent Framework to intercept signals from independent AI/ML agents
•	Intelligence Store to provide continuous insights (both transient and long term)
•	Knowledge Graph for connected data
Through these, the Enterprise.Brain orchestrates intelligent responses and enables cognitive actions to direct signals (from explicit events), as well as proactively incite action from indirect signals (detected through an independent agent).

Enterprise.Brain empowers across fabric of an enterprise to be as digital analytics enterprise providing objective and value-driven digital insights that help enterprises on multiple facets
1.	Internal employees driven needs – app economy to serve and automate end users requirements
2.	Operations, Shared Infra and Connected apps through shared data
3.	For businesses on elevating critical marketing, growth and expansion challenges

**Observability Services **enable recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system located within reach for monitoring and analysis using telemetry. Telemetry can bring insights on which features end users use the most, how are they using them, what are the bugs and issues, and thereby offer better visibility into performance, doing away with the need to solicit direct feedback from users. 

These services have been designed to allow users to switch between different telemetry/analytics services. This means that after going live, if one decides to switch from telemetry provider 1 to telemetry provider 2, the developers don't need to make any changes in the code. A change in the configuration file is all it takes.	

**Process Mining**  will help clients understand how well their business processes are functioning, by extracting them from the digital footprints of their IT systems. It helps uncover variations in business processes, root causes for delays, and provides actionable insights that can help save money, reduce process time, and enhance customer experience. 

**Insights into Variations**: Provides insights including visuals into variations in business processes and map them to factors such as line of business, geography and thereby enable you to reimagine your business processes to optimize and standardize them.

**Eliminate Frictions**:
Identifies the friction points in your business processes that are causing delays thereby enabling you to eliminate them.

**Optimize Outcomes**: Provides actionable insights with automated actions that help you optimize the process resulting in reduced costs and customer delight.	

**Knowledge Graph**	

We envision through TigerGraph as an enterprise-wide tool that links all information not only from transactions but also from mapping complex interactions between employees, networks and devices in the organization in near-real time. The graph links all silos of enterprise data improving end-to-end visibility, contextualizes them to assist in prioritizing and displaying relevant information to users, and drives intelligence through the digital brain.	

**AI services**

A key to approaching sentience, AI Services dominate the processes and technologies a Live Enterprise operates upon. Connecting all the data that exists in the different lines of business through a knowledge graph and real-time analytical databases enable us to make sense of the events or signals. Using a combination of deterministic methods and AI services including vision, speech, text, NLP and NLQ, the digital brain determines how to respond to these business or user events/actions in real-time.

Facilitating automation of routine tasks across enterprise layers and functions, AI services not only enable intuitive decision making at scale but also free up the workforce. It helps reimagine AI-first business processes and features to drive exponential value and efficiency, bringing in zero latency and agility. It also helps create a digital runway for the enterprise allowing for launch of projects, functions, etc., at great velocity. 



Tell us how your entry was the most...					

- Impactful in solving a real world problem 
Today’s pandemic environment has put a giant spotlight on the inflexible, often broken supply chains due to siloed processes & disparate systems, lack of integration across all internal and external network entities leading to poor visibility and delay in responding to changes. 
Developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven solution with connected Enterprise framework to help companies become more intelligent and dynamic. Core to this capability is the “Enterprise Brain” 

- Innovative use case of graph
Through defined framework for each enterprise to develop their own enterprise brain with 
Observability Services  
Process Mining 
Knowledge Graph 
AI services

- Ambitious and complex graph
Enterprise  brain powers the Connected enterprise through real-time contextual intelligence and autonomous insights applied to enterprise, personas and processes. 

This leads to enterprises discovering new revenue streams and unleashing exponential possibilities.
